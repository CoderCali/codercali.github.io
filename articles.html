  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu can teach us many valuable life lessons… One of them being to keep going.
<br>
Andre Galvao has learned that lesson well throughout his lengthy and extremely successful career as a BJJ competitor.
He was in a situation where he could’ve quit many times, but he refused to do so. Instead, he kept at it.
"I remember my camp, against Gordon’s fight, I busted my knee very badly…
My knee went out of place – PLAU! Then I put it back in place.

There were about thirty minutes left to finish the training. I finished training.

The guy were asking me to stop… “I will finish training, bro! It doesn’t matter, I’ll finish training.”

Andre understands that it’s difficult to carry oneself like that, but it’s necessary.
Especially because life situations can (and will) be like that. So, it’s vital to learn how to keep performing even with the pressure stacking up:

"And so, it is difficult for an athlete to think like this.
It will come at the time of the fight, something will happen… And you will have to go all the way!

And in life, it’s like that too! Sport teaches us for life, right? When training, you overcome yourself.
And in life, it’s like that too; problems come and then… What are you going to do?

Problems come, difficulty hits you. What are you going to do?
Surrender or continue?"

How often should I train Jiu-Jitsu?
  How often you train jiu jitsu will depend on your goals and schedule. For beginners, two to three times per week is a good starting point. This allows you to learn the fundamentals and build a base level of skill and conditioning. As you progress, you may want to train more frequently.
For those looking to compete, training four to six times per week is recommended. This high frequency allows you to learn and drill new techniques at a rapid pace, build muscle memory, and improve your conditioning to match the demands of competition.
For elite competitors, training twice a day, six to seven days per week may be needed. An intense training regimen at this level allows competitors to optimize skill development, physical preparation, and strategy. However, this requires a significant time commitment and may be unsustainable for most people.

In general, aim for consistency over intensity when first starting out. Showing up to your scheduled classes will build good habits and help you avoid injuries that can derail your progress. As you adapt, you can slowly increase your training frequency by one or two sessions per week. Listen to your body and adjust as needed based on your soreness, fatigue and life demands. Taking an occasional deload week where you drop sessions can stave off overtraining.

How often you train BJJ really depends on your goals. But consistency, allowing for recovery, and building up your frequency gradually are keys to enjoying jiu jitsu for the long term, regardless of your competitive ambitions. Start with two to three sessions per week and adjust from there based on your progress and priorities.
